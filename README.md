# Regression-Task-Minimization

In this repository, there are several methods to optimize the *Regression Task* including:

* Least Linear Squares
* Stochastic Gradient Descent with Adam Optimizer
* Minibatch Gradient Descent

In addition to these algorithms, there are some methods to evaluate the model.
